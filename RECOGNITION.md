# Recognizing contributions

The most common form of individual contribution to the Flux project is
time and effort. Thus, the project recognises people who reported
issues, fixed bugs, wrote documentation, reviewed pull requests, and
so on, by thanking them on the Flux website.

However, there are other ways to support the Flux project, especially
as an organisation, and we would like to be generous in expressing
gratitude to anyone that helps.

Here are other kinds of contribution that could be recognized:

 - committing team members' time to the project (e.g., someone working
   a day a week on Flux)
 - donating cloud platform credits or a free account to be used for
   automation
 - sponsoring the employment of contributors and maintainers

The processes around sponsorship are explained in
[SPONSORSHIP.md](SPONSORSHIP.md).
