# Flux Governance

This document <https://github.com/fluxcd/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md> defines the governance process for the Flux CNCF project and community.

## Values

- **Open:**
The Flux community strives to be open, accessible and welcoming to everyone.
Anyone may contribute, and contributions are available to all users according to open source values and licenses.
- **Transparent:**
Flux strives for transparency in all discussions, announcements, disclosures and decision making.
- **Unbiased:**
Flux strives to operate independently of specific partisan interests, and for decision making to fairly balance the wider community interests of its end users and contributors.

### Code of Conduct

The Flux community adheres to the CNCF Code of Conduct <https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md>.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting a _Flux_ project maintainer.

If no conclusion can be reached in meditation, such issues can be escalated to the CNCF mediator, Mishi Choudhary <mishi@linux.com>, in which case CNCF may choose to intervene.

## Roles in the Flux Community

The Flux community is comprised of the following roles:

### Users

Flux end users are the most important aspect of the community, without whom the project would have no purpose. Users are anyone who has a need for the project.
Apart from following the Code of Conduct, there are no special requirements.

### Contributors

Flux welcomes all kinds of contributions, including code, issues, documentation, external tools, advocacy and community work.
As a contributor we want to invite you to join the discussions in a variety of fora laid out in <https://github.com/fluxcd/community>.

### Maintainers

Maintainers are elected Contributors who showed significant and sustained contributions in particular sub-project. A majority of positive votes of current maintainers is sufficient.

Maintainers are expected to:

- enable and promote Flux community Values
- engage with end Users through appropriate communication channels appropriate to their teams
- serve as a point of conflict resolution between Contributors to the Flux area appropriate to their teams
- maintain open collaboration within and across teams
- ask for help when unsure and step down considerately

Ultimately the collective of maintainers - after consulting with their community - drive the direction, values and governance of the project.
