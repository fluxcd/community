# Flux community

The [Flux project](https://github.com/fluxcd) aspires to be a vendor-neutral home for GitOps in a Cloud Native world.

Started 2016 to automate deployments at Weaveworks, the project has grown dramatically since then. Especially since the planning of Flux v2 and GitOps Toolkit SDK it became clearer that the scope became more ambitious and that the Flux project has become the home for the Flux family of projects, all solving specific GitOps needs.

## Rules

The Flux community is governed by the [governance document](GOVERNANCE.md). We as a community follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing

The Flux project is always looking for new contributors and there are a multitude of ways to get involved.
Depending on what you want to do, some of the following bits might be your first steps:

- Join our upcoming dev meetings ([meeting access and agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l_M0om0qUEN_NNiGgpqJ2tvsF2iioHkaARDeh6b70B0/view))
