# Joining the Flux community

We want the [Flux project](https://github.com/fluxcd) to be the vendor-neutral home for GitOps in a Cloud Native world.

Started 2016 to automate deployments at Weaveworks, the project has grown dramatically since then.
Especially since the planning of Flux v2 and GitOps Toolkit SDK it was clearer that the scope became more ambitious and that the Flux project has become the home for the Flux family of projects, all solving specific GitOps needs.

We also want our community to be diverse, helpful, collaborative and a fun place to be, so we would love to have you join us!

## Getting involved

### Finding your interest

To get started, it's important you find out which parts of Flux you are interested in first.

Maintained, with stable APIs:

- Flux: <https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2>
- As a Helm user: <https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-controller>

Currently stable:

- Progressive delivery, e.g. blue-green testing, etc. <https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger>

Legacy projects, mostly just receive security updates:

- Flux Legacy: <https://github.com/fluxcd/flux>
- As a Helm user: <https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-operator>

And there is loads more under <https://github.com/fluxcd>, we all work on this as a community together.

### Joining the community

All the projects have docs to help you get started, so a first step is obviously using the projects and getting some first-hand experience.
Afterwards you can help out on Slack answering questions, maybe extend the docs or fix some small issues.

### Teams

The Flux project uses [GitHub org teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations) to make it easier for [Project Members](community-roles.md#project-members) and above to communicate within and across teams.
Members of those teams however should be defined in publicly accessible files for transparency to org non-members.
See [community-roles.md](community-roles.md).

The process of formalising team structures apart from "interest in one or more given sub-project(s)" is ongoing.
There currently are:

- The [Oversight committee](GOVERNANCE.md#oversight-committee)
- The [Security team](SECURITY.md)
- The [Community team](COMMUNITY.md)

All projects and teams are open to contributors and every part of the Flux project appreciates your help and consideration.
Check out the links above to learn more about the team in question.

### Meetings

## Maintainers

Flux project maintainers may differ across Git repositories within the `fluxcd` GitHub org.
The codebase itself is a multi-component design, spread across multiple Git repositories.
Flux also includes non-code contributions, such as documentation and community information.
Maintainers of each repo are listed in a MAINTAINERS file in the root of that repo.

See [project/flux-project-maintainers.yaml](./project/flux-project-maintainers.yaml) for an aggregated list of all maintainers from each of the project's individual Git repos.

## Rules

The Flux community is governed by the [governance document](GOVERNANCE.md), and involvement is defined in [community-roles.md](community-roles.md).
We as a community follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
